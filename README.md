 This application focuses on developing a straightforward yet efficient task management application where users can add, mark as completed, and delete items on their to-do list.

**Objective:**
* To provide an intuitive user interface for managing to-do lists.
* To visually indicate completed tasks for clear progress tracking.
* To maintain an organized list by allowing easy removal of tasks.
* To ensure tasks are preserved between sessions using local storage.
* To create a responsive design for optimal use on different devices.

 **Technologies used:**
* HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the layout of the to-do list application.
* CSS: Employed for styling the application, including the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
* JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity to the application, such as adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed.
* Bootstrap: Utilized for creating a responsive and modern user interface with pre-designed components and grid layout.
* Local Storage: Implemented to save the to-do list items in the user's browser, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

**Functionalities:**
1. Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
2. Task Removal: Each task has a delete button (Ã—) that allows users to remove tasks from the list.
3. Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task, which toggles a check mark.
4. Data Persistence: The to-do list is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring tasks remain even after the page is refreshed.
5. Responsive Design: The application adjusts its layout for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on various devices.
